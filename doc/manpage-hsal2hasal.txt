NAME
        bin/hsal2hasal - construct relational abstraction of HybridSAL models

SYNOPSIS
        bin/hasal [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
        Construct a relational abstraction of the model in [FILE].
        Create a new SAL file containing the abstract model.
        Input file is expected to be in HybridSAL (.hsal) syntax, or
        HybridSAL's XML representation (.hxml).
        The new file will have the same name as [FILE], but
        a different extension, .sal

        Options include:
        -c, --copyguard
            Explicitly handle the guards in the continuous dynamics
            as state invariants
        -n, --nonlinear
            Create a nonlinear abstract model
            Note that freely available model checkers are unable
            to handle nonlinear models, hence this option is 
            useful for research purposes only.
        -t <T>, --timed <T>
            Create a timed relational abstraction assuming that
            the controller is run every <T> time units.
            <T> should be a number (such as, 0.01)
        -o, --optimize
            Create an optimized relational abstraction.
            Certain transient's are unsoundly eliminated from the
            abstract SAL model to improve performance of the model 
            checkers on the generated SAL model.
