NAME
        bin/hasal2sal - convert hybridsal in XML to standard notation

SYNOPSIS
        bin/hasal2sal [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
        Extract the discrete part of the transition system contained in
        the hybrid abstract HybridSAL file [FILE], with .hasal extension, 
        and pretty print it.
        The input is assumed to be a file with extension .hasal
        The output is written in a new file that has the same
        name as [FILE], but a different extension, namely .sal.

        There is no analysis performed; it is a purely syntactic extraction.
