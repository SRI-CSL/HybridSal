A short note on timed relational abstraction
--------------------------------------------

Timed relational abstraction is a technique for analyzing control
systems where the controller runs on a time-triggered schedule.
If T is the sampling time period, the assumption is that, every
T time units, the controller samples the plant, computes the
control values, and actuates the plant.
When analyzing such time-triggered control systems,
it is important to consider the effect of sampling at discrete
time instances.  It is possible that a control system is stable
when continuous or event-triggered sampling is assumed, but
it becomes unstable under time-triggered sampling.
Timed relational abstraction extends the original relational
abstraction technique by supporting the analysis of time-triggered
control systems.

The HybridSAL relational abstraction tool was extended by
including a prototype implementation of timed relational
abstraction.  The implementation was used to analyze several
models of simple control systems with and without the time-based
sampling assumption.  Extensive testing of the tool is
underway to determine its value and scalability.
