% Using timed relational abstraction to study stability
% When a controller that is designed to be stable in the continuous domain
% Is implemented on a discrete platform, 
% the resulting system could be unstable.

% Consider a 1-dimensional continuous plant: dx/dt = 5*x(t) + u(t)
% We are given a simple PI-controller.  u(t) = -30*x(t)-y(t)
% where dy/dt = x
% We assume controller samples x(t) every T seconds and update u then.
% Here we analyze for T = 0.05s

% We assume the controller gets values of x(t)
% from the plant at specific time instants.
% (For e.g., x(t) is sent from plant to controller
% on a time-triggered bus).

% Current timed relational abstraction does not generate 
% the fact (x'-5*y')-(x-5*y) = 0.05*u in the timed abstraction
% We need that to prove stability below
