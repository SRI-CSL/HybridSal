Installation instructions for HybridSAL Relational Abstractor:
---------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Make sure your system has python 2.6
 We also use the scipy package of python. So make sure
 it is installed. On Ubuntu, it can be installed using:
   sudo aptitude install python-numpy  
   sudo aptitude install python-scipy  

(2) Run 
  make install

(3) Run 
 make sal2xml
 This will test if the hybridsal2xml is installed properly
 Nothing works if hybridsal2xml is not installed properly

 make 
 This will test if the relational abstraction is installed properly.
 Running make will automatically create abstractions of the
 files in examples/*.hsal


How to use the relational abstractions?
---------------------------------------
The relational abstraction are written in SAL files, hence
SAL tools can be applied to it.
For example, sal-inf-bmc can be used to perform infinite 
bounded model checking on the SAL files to verify safety
properties or obtain counter examples.
Note: Auxiliary lemmas may be needed.
 In some cases, <filename>.sal.proved contains such
 auxiliary lemmas and the sal command to prove properties.
 Do a "diff <filename>.sal.proved <filename>.sal" to see
 what auxiliary lemmas were added.

sal-inf-bmc and other SAL tools are publicly available
from http://sal.csl.sri.com/
