# Generate constraints that need to be solved
# for finding the relational abstraction

# Input: Hybrid Sal model in XML syntax
# Output: Hybrid Sal model in XML syntax
# Output will have relational abstractions 
# of all continuous modes

# Idea for relational abstraction
# collect all x s.t. dx/dt = constant
# replace them by their rel abs.
# all other x's: d (x;y) = (A B; 0 0) (x;y) + (b1;b2)
# Suppose c'A=l c' is a left eigenvector of A with eigenvalue l
# Pick d' s.t. l d' = c' B
# d/dt(c'x+d'y)=c'(Ax+By+b1)+d'b2 = l c'x + l d'y + c'b1 + d'b2
# Let p := (c'x+d'y+ (c'b1+d'b2)/l) THEN dp/dt = l p

# If we fail to find eigen, we need BOX invs -- for later...

# we need eigenvalue and eigenvector computation for square matrix
# will do that using iteration method for now until scalability
# becomes an issue
