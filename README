src/ : Source code of the relational abstractor for hybrid systems

examples/ : Examples 
  The examples are written as <filename>.hsal 
  The relational abstractor AUTOMATICALLY constructs
  <filename>.hasal and <filename>.sal
    <filename>.hsal :  HybridSAL specification of the hybrid system
    <filename>.hasal: Augmented HybridSAL (original + abstraction)
    <filename>.sal:   SAL file containing abstraction of <filename>.hsal

hybridsal2xml/ : This directory contains code that parses a HybridSAL
 (or Augmented HybridSAL file) and creates an XML for it.
 

How to run the tool?
---------------------
After installing (see file INSTALL), you can use the tool by
(1) Build a .hsal model  (see examples in examples/<filename>.hsal)
  Suppose you create examples/mytest.hsal
(2) From this directory, run the command:
  make examples/mytest.sal
  This should create the file examples/mytest.sal -- which is a
  relational abstraction of the file examples/mytest.hsal
(3) Analyze examples/mytest.sal using SAL model checkers.
  For Step~(3), you need to download and install SAL tools
  (http://sal.csl.sri.com).  Once installed, you can verify
  examples/mytest.sal using the command 
  (given from inside the subdirectory examples/):
   sal-inf-bmc -d 5 mytest <property>
  where <property> is the name of the property inside the file
  mytest.hsal
For detailed explanation on ONE small example, see the document
 doc/hsal-ra-report.pdf

How to run the demo?
--------------------
Powertrain
-----------
To analyze the powertrain model, run the following commands
   bin/hsal2hasal -o examples/powertrain.hsal
This will create the file examples/powertrain.sal
Now model check using the following commands
   cd examples
   sal-inf-bmc -d 12 powertrain nochatter
This verifies the 'nochatter' property of powertrain.
Now change the initial condition: increase 
grade to 0.15 (15% grade).   Now, re-verify.
   sal-inf-bmc -d 12 powertrain nochatter
You will get a trace that shows violation of the property.
Note that we can analyze the property for a range of 
initial conditions using just ONE run.

Blood Glucose (incomplete)
-------------
Relationally abstract a 8-dimensional blood glucose system:
   bin/hsal2hasal examples/BGL.hsal
The model is incomplete and lacking dynamics of 
Insulin, insulin-injection controller, and a verification 
property.

Navigation Examples:
-------------------
The navigation examples are present in files nav*.hsal
nav01b models the different squares in the grid as
different components.  HybridSAL supports compositional
modeling -- different components can be modeled as different 
MODULEs in HybridSAL.
   bin/hsal2hasal examples/nav01b.hsal
   cd examples
   sal-inf-bmc -d 6 nav01b canreach
   sal-inf-bmc -i -d 6 nav01b correct
The first command creates nav01b.sal, the last two runs of
sal-inf-bmc check two different properties: one is false
and the other is true (and proved by sal-inf-bmc).

The same can be done on nav01.hsal file -- which is the
same as nav01b.hsal, but models the entire system
as a SINGLE MODULE, rather than as a composition of 
different MODULES (as done in nav01b.hsal)
Irrespective of the modeling style, the analysis time
and results are the same.
   bin/hsal2hasal examples/nav01.hsal
   cd examples
   sal-inf-bmc -d 6 nav01 canreach
   sal-inf-bmc -i -d 6 nav01 correct

Train-Gate-Controller:
----------------------
The file tgc.hsal contains a model of a train-gate-controller.
Note that the discrete behavior of train, gate, and controller 
are modeled as different MODULES;  the continuous behavior
(time elapse) is modeled as a separate MODULE; and finally 
there is one MODULE that enforces the interaction correctly.
Thus, tgc.hsal has five modules and the system is a COMPOSITION
of these five MODULEs.
We can create the relational abstraction, and then verify, using
the following commands:
   bin/hsal2hasal examples/TGC.hsal
   cd examples
   sal-inf-bmc -i -d 10 TGC correct
   sal-inf-bmc -d 10 TGC canreach
   sal-inf-bmc -d 10 TGC canreach1

RLC Circuit:
------------
A simple model of the RLC circuit using three differential equations
is presented in RLC.hsal
   bin/hsal2hasal examples/RLC.hsal
   cd examples
   sal-inf-bmc -i -d 5 RLC correct
   sal-inf-bmc -d 5 RLC canreach
 
Other simple examples:
-----------------
Simple Thermostat: SimpleThermo4.hsal
Other linear continuous dynamical systems: Linear*.hsal
See doc/hsal-ra-report.pdf for explanation of the working of
the relational abstractor on the example examples/Linear1.hsal
