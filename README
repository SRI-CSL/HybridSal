src/ : Source code of the relational abstractor for hybrid systems

examples/ : Examples 
  The examples are written as <filename>.hsal 
  The relational abstractor AUTOMATICALLY constructs
  <filename>.hasal and <filename>.sal
    <filename>.hsal :  HybridSAL specification of the hybrid system
    <filename>.hasal: Augmented HybridSAL (original + abstraction)
    <filename>.sal:   SAL file containing abstraction of <filename>.hsal

hybridsal2xml/ : This directory contains code that parses a HybridSAL
 (or Augmented HybridSAL file) and creates an XML for it.
 

How to run the tool?
---------------------
After installing (see file INSTALL), you can use the tool by
(1) Build a .hsal model  (see examples in examples/<filename>.hsal)
  Suppose you create examples/mytest.hsal
(2) From this directory, run the command:
  make examples/mytest.sal
  This should create the file examples/mytest.sal -- which is a
  relational abstraction of the file examples/mytest.hsal
(3) Analyze examples/mytest.sal using SAL model checkers.
  For Step~(3), you need to download and install SAL tools
  (http://sal.csl.sri.com).  Once installed, you can verify
  examples/mytest.sal using the command 
  (given from inside the subdirectory examples/):
   sal-inf-bmc -d 5 mytest <property>
  where <property> is the name of the property inside the file
  mytest.hsal
