Converter from Modelica to HybridSal
------------------------------------

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
Go to parent directory (cd ..) and run 'make install' there

HOW TO TEST (EASY)
------------------
Go to parent directory (cd ..) and run 'make RCEngine' there
or run 'make RCEngineFull' there


HOW TO TEST 2
-------------
examples/ directory contains some Modelica XML models.

The tool can be run on any model, say RCEngine.xml, as follows:

python src/modelica2hsal.py examples/RCEngine.xml

or, with a context file, as
python src/modelica2hsal.py examples/RCEngine.xml examples/context-property.xml

The result is a file called  examples/RCEngineModel.hsal

CAVEAT
------
Sometimes the XML created by OpenModelica compiler is
not well-formed, and the python's XML parser fails to 
parse it. 

Here are some common reasons:
1. There is an occurrence of \"  inside a string
2. There is an occurrence of a < or > inside a string.
   All < should be replaced by &lt; and > by &gt;
3. Sometime function declarations have code; and the
   code results in a not well-formed XML.

Currently, the tool DOES NOT fix these bugs in the
XML generated by Modelica.
